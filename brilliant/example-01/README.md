# README for PA 2.3: iTer-remoto

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 2.3. Due: complete this PA prior to class on **Wednesday**, Nov 27!).*

_You can access this assignment with the following link: [classroom.github.com/a/MbJc5oCJ](https://classroom.github.com/a/MbJc5oCJ)._

This assignment will address a few simple, but useful, topics related to indexing and iterating in Python, illustrated with an annotated stem figure. The content of this PA is simple, but will be used directly in the **Wednesday** workshop this week.

Specifically, we will look at:
- iterables and iterable objects
- iterables `range`, `enumerate` and `zip`
- the modulo operator `%`
- plot type `stem`

**Note that the Wednesday workshop will use stem plots, so we strongly encourage you to do this early in the week---but only if you have time after covering the DFT chapter in the book!**

There are three files in this PA:
- this `README.md`
- a notebook `PA_2_3_iter_remoto.ipynb`
- an image `earthquakes.svg`, which you are asked to duplicate

## Grading Criteria

You will pass this PA if:
1. Your notebook `PA_2_3_iter_remoto.ipynb` runs without errors.
2. After running your notebook, a file `my_earthquake.svg` is created in the repository that contains your version of the image.

**End of file.**
