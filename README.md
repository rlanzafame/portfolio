# Robert's Teaching Portfolio

A collection of websites, materials and links.

The purpose is to facilitate sharing, especially when materials are hard to extract from their original education context (e.g., password-protected, difficult to find, etc). Also a way to preserve sites that are archived.

Goal is to have this structure, where the materials are accessed at `http://rlanzafame.github.io/portfolio/item-1`
