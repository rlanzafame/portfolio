# Example 4: Narrative for Introducing Probabilistic Dependence

My fourth and final example illustrates a page where the topic of probabilistic dependence is introduced. I believe this is a good example of my writing that teaches a complicated and often misunderstood topic by relating it to real world examples, while still presenting the theory in a clear way. The story-telling narrative is typical of the education material I create.
